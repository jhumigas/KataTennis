# KATATENNIS

Simple proposition for the [KataTennis](http://codingdojo.org/kata/Tennis/).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Main requirement is [Java SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), make sure you have your computer properly configured.


I used IntelliJ to write code, which you can get [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows).

### Running

You can use IntelliJ directly. 
Or use `javac` (compilation) and `java`(interpreting and running) commands.

### Test

You can find them in `test`, I used [JUnit4](https://github.com/junit-team/junit4) for unit testing.
You can use directly IntelliJ to run them.
